### Analysis Summary

I can create a diagram, but I need more information. What kind of diagram would you like to create? For example, are you looking for:

*   A diagram of the overall system architecture?
*   A diagram showing the relationships within a specific file?
*   A diagram illustrating a particular process or data flow?

Please provide more details about what you'd like to visualize, and I'll do my best to generate a relevant diagram.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Understanding the Diagram Request**
   The user is asking for clarification on what kind of diagram they would like to create. The system is prompting the user to provide more details about their visualization needs.
